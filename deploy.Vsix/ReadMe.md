Run `Build.bat` to build VSIX package `DevZest.Data.Tools`

In current directory, run the following command:

```bash
.\Build.bat 1.0.*
```

The result `DevZest.Data.Tools.vsix`, with version 1.0.20190311 (* replaced with current date), will be built under `DevZest.Data.Tools\bin\Release` directory.

Note: When repo is newly cloned, the sub folder `DevZest.Data.Tools` does not exist. You need to run `Sync.DevZest.Data.Tools.bat` to create this folder automatically.
