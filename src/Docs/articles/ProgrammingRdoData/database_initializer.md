# Database Initializer

A database initializer is a class that takes care of database creation and initialization. You can initialize your database with all tables via deriving your database initializer class from <xref:DevZest.Data.DbGenerator`1> class, or you can mock your database with subset of tables via deriving your database initializer class from <xref:DevZest.Data.DbMock`1> class.
