Particularly, these difficulties are referred to as the [object-relational impedance mismatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch).
* Database testing, still stays on principles and guidelines. No widely practical use yet. Refactoring or changing an enterprise application is time consuming and error prone.
* Existing data presentation solutions are far from ideal.

Refactoring or changing data presentation code is time consuming and error prone.
