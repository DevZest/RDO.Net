* You're writing native SQL using C#/VB.Net, 100% strongly typed - unbeatable for both code maintainability and performance!
* JSON serialization/deserialization is a first class citizen - unbeatable performance because no reflection required.
* Database testing and deployment is a first class citizen. You can easily mock part of database with testing data, generate database from clean C#/VB.Net code, or generate C#/VB.Net code from table data in database, right in Visual Studio.
* The rich metadata can be consumed conveniently by other layer of your application such as data presentation.
