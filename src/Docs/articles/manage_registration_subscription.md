An email will be sent to verify your email address. Email address must be verified before accessing the account.

If you're using Visual Studio Community Edition, you're all set here.

## Subscription

If you're using Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise edition, you must have any valid subscription of the following:

* Trial: Free for experiment within one month. Valid for current user only.
* Individual: Subscription purchased individually. Valid for current user only.
* Team Member: You can join a team to consume a Team Subscription which is purchased/renewed for a group of developers, to reduce number of purchases.

You can find pricing of the individual and team subscription [here](https://my.devzest.com/Pricing).

Subscriptions of any user can be consumed concurrently by up to 3 machines (instances). Instance can be deleted if unwanted.

Team Subscription:

* Team subscription allows shared subscriptions for a group of developers. Use team subscription to reduce number of purchases and unify the expiration dates for the whole team.
* After purchased, a `Member Key` (GUID) will be generated for each team subscription. You, as the owner or administrator, can distribute this Member Key to your team members to consume this team subscription. Team subscription is priced and controlled by the `Team Size`; joined team members can resign from this team subscription so that other members can consume it.
* An `Admin Key` will also be generated for each team subscription. You can invite other people to be administrator of this team subscription by using this Admin Key. Administrators can perform management tasks such as renewing or resizing the team, monitoring team members, regenerating the Member or Admin Key, etc.
* The team can `upsize` or `downsize` at any time, with proportional price. The downsize amount will result in an increase to your `team redeemable balance`, which will be deducted for your next payment of this team automatically.
* Team subscription owner can be transferred to another administrator.
