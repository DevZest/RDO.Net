# RDO.Tools License

Last Updated: 28 Jun 2019

DevZest RDO.Tools

These license terms are an agreement between you and DevZest. They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any DevZest services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

## INSTALLATION AND REGISTRATION

a. Visual Studio Editions. RDO.Tools is licensed based on your Visual Studio Editions. It's free for Visual Studio Community Edition; A subscription is required for other editions (Professional/Enterprise). See [Pricing](https://my.devzest.com/Pricing). A license violation of Visual Studio will result in a license violation of RDO.Tools too. For example, if you don't have a license for Visual Studio Community Edition, using RDO.Tools in Visual Studio Community Edition is a license violation.

b. Registration. Registration is required via https://my.devzest.com, providing your email address, name and optionally name of your organization, despite of your Visual Studio edition. You must ensure the correctness of the information for registration.

## USE RIGHTS

a. General. One user may use copies of the software on your devices to develop and test applications. This includes using copies of the software on your own internal servers that remain fully dedicated to your own use. You may not, however, separate the components of the software and run those in a production environment, or on third party devices (except as otherwise stated in this agreement), or for any purpose other than developing and testing your applications.

b. Demo Use. The use permitted above includes use of the software in demonstrating your applications.

c. Backup copy. You may make one backup copy of the software, for reinstalling the software.

Our privacy statement is located at [https://my.devzest.com/Privacy](https://my.devzest.com/Privacy). You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

## SCOPE OF LICENSE

The software is licensed, not sold. These license terms only give you some rights to use the software. DevZest reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in these license terms. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. In addition, you may not:

* use the software in any way that is against the law;
* share, publish, rent or lease the software; or
* provide the software as a stand-alone offering or combine it with any of your applications for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
